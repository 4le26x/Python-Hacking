This repository contains a series of Python tools developed as part of my learning journey through the "Python Ofensivo" course by Hack4U and the "Learn Python & Ethical Hacking From Scratch" course on Udemy. These tools focus on the offensive capabilities of Python, built to strengthen my foundation in the language.

Each script in this repository has been enhanced from its original version. Improvements include error validation, customized output, and the addition of libraries to enrich functionality. A help menu has also been integrated to make the tools more user-friendly and accessible.

The primary goal of this repository is to showcase the projects developed following these courses, providing insight into the practical applications of Python in ethical hacking.
